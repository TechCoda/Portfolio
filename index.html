    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Rayyan Kerkmaz, an aspiring data analyst and software developer with a strong foundation in problem-solving, coding, and continuous learning. Over the past few months, I’ve immersed myself in the world of software development, tackling projects that span both backend development with Java and Spring and creating dynamic, user-friendly web interfaces.</p>
    <p>What excites me most about programming is the challenge of transforming complex problems into simple, efficient solutions. I thrive in environments where I can learn through hands-on projects, constantly refining my skills as I take on new tasks. Whether I’m debugging code, brainstorming ideas for a project, or carefully documenting each change, I always strive for clarity and precision in my work.</p>
    <p>My approach to learning is one of curiosity and persistence. I’m not afraid to dive into unfamiliar topics or to ask questions when I’m unsure. I believe in the power of collaboration and learning from others, and I take pride in creating solutions that are both functional and innovative. As I continue to grow as a developer, I remain committed to ethical problem-solving and delivering quality work that makes a positive impact.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy engaging in side projects, contributing to open-source communities, and sharpening my skills in data analysis and visualization. My goal is to merge my passion for technology with my desire to make a meaningful contribution to the world through the work I do.</p>
