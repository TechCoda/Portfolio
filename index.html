        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I’m Rayyan Kerkmaz, a passionate Computer Science student and tech enthusiast on a journey to turn my love for technology into a fulfilling career. With a knack for embracing change and a curiosity that drives me to explore new tech skills, I’m excited to see where this path leads.

When I'm not coding or learning about the latest tech trends, you’ll likely find me enjoying a thrilling scary movie or spending quality time with my family. As a parent of two wonderful kids, I understand the importance of balancing work and family life, and I bring that same dedication and enthusiasm to my tech projects.

Before diving into the world of technology, I gained valuable experience working as a Sales/Reservations Agent and Customer Service Manager at a limo company. These roles honed my problem-solving skills and taught me the value of clear communication and exceptional service.

I’m particularly interested in data analytics and am eager to delve deeper into how data-driven insights can drive innovation. Though I’m still relatively new to tech, the thrill of discovering new tools and techniques has been incredibly rewarding. Each step in this learning journey has fueled my passion and strengthened my commitment to making a meaningful impact in the tech world.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I look forward to connecting and exploring new opportunities in the ever-evolving field of technology.</p>
